## HR Department Employee Attrition Prediction

### Project Overview
Hiring and retaining employees are complex tasks for businesses, consuming valuable resources in terms of capital, time, and skills. This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging data science techniques to predict which employees are more likely to quit, enabling proactive HR strategies.

### Problem Statement
Small business owners spend 40% of their working hours on tasks such as hiring.</br>
Companies allocate 15% to 20% of an employee's salary to recruit a new candidate.</br>
An Average comapany losses anywhere between 1% and 2.5% of their total revenue on the time it takes to bring a new hire up to speed.</br>
Hiring a new employee costs an avearge of $7645 (0-500 corporation).</br>
It takes 52 days on average to fill position.


### Data Science Approach
As a Data Scientist at a multinational corporation, the HR team provided an extensive dataset on employees. The primary objective was to develop a predictive model for employee attrition.


## Project Workflow
1. Import Libraries and Dataset:

- Utilized Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) for data manipulation and analysis.
- Loaded and inspected the HR dataset.

2. Visualize Dataset:

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
- Used visualizations (e.g., bar plots, histograms) to understand the distribution of key features.

3. Train-Test Split and Data Cleaning:

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Addressed missing values and outliers through appropriate data cleaning techniques.

4. Data Visualization and Correletion:

- Created visualizations to depict relationships between variables.
- Identified patterns or trends that could impact attrition predictions.

5. Train and Build Model:

- Implemented logistic regression, random forest classifier, and artificial neural network (ANN) models.
- Trained models on the training dataset to learn patterns associated with employee attrition.
- Explored metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate model performance.
