# Chest Disease Detection with Deep Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on automating the detection and classification of chest diseases to enhance the efficiency of diagnosis in a hospital in downtown Toronto. As a Deep Learning consultant, the goal is to develop a model capable of detecting and classifying chest diseases within one minute, thereby reducing both the cost and time associated with traditional detection methods.

## Problem Statement

The hospital team has provided a dataset consisting of 133 images categorized into four classes: 
1. Healthy
2. COVID-19
3. Bacterial Pneumonia
4. Viral Pneumonia

The task is to leverage the power of Deep Learning to create a model that accurately classifies these images, contributing to faster and more cost-effective disease diagnosis.

## Project Features

1. **Deep Learning Algorithms:**
   - Utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification.
   - Implement Deep Learning algorithms, with a focus on RESNET, a widely adopted architecture in business and healthcare.

2. **Transfer Learning:**
   - Apply transfer learning techniques to leverage pre-trained RESNET networks for efficient model training.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the trained RESNET networks on testing data to assess the model's accuracy and reliability.

4. **Activation Functions:**
   - Implement various activation functions such as Softmax, ReLU, etc., to optimize the model's performance.

5. **Deep CNN Model with Keras:**
   - Utilize the Keras library to build a robust Deep CNN model tailored for chest disease classification.

6. **Precision and Recall:**
   - Employ precision and recall metrics to assess the model's performance, ensuring a balanced evaluation of classification results.
