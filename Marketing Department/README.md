# Customer Segmentation and Targeted Marketing Project
## Customer Insights360

## Introduction
Customer Insights360 is a data science project aimed at enhancing the marketing strategies of a bank in New York City through the application of data science techniques. The primary objective is to perform customer segmentation using advanced methodologies such as K-means clustering, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), and Autoencoders. The insights gained from segmentation will empower the marketing team to launch targeted advertising campaigns tailored to specific customer needs.

## Project Setup
- **Dependencies:** List of necessary libraries and versions required for the project.
- **Usage:** Instructions on how to set up and run the project to reproduce results.

## Data Cleaning
- Addressed inconsistencies or errors in the dataset.
- Described how missing values were handled, including imputation strategies.
- Documented any transformations applied to the data for better analysis.

## Data Exploration and Visualization
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the cleaned customer dataset.
- Visualized key features using plots like distplot, histplot, and KDE.

## K-means Clustering
- Implemented the K-means clustering algorithm for customer segmentation.
- Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.
- Applied K-means clustering using scikit-learn.

## PCA for Dimensionality Reduction
- Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
- Explained how PCA works and its application in customer segmentation.

## Autoencoders for Dimensionality Reduction
- Implemented Autoencoders using Keras for further dimensionality reduction.
- Provided insights into the benefits of Autoencoders in capturing complex patterns.

## Results and Insights
