# CustomerSentimentAnalyzer: Predicting Customer Satisfaction with NLP

## Project Overview

In the realm of Public Relations, understanding customer sentiment is crucial for maintaining a positive brand image. This project involves leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to build predictive models for sentiment analysis on social media posts and reviews. The goal is to automatically determine whether customers are satisfied with the product based on their textual reviews. By converting words into numbers and training machine learning models, the Public Relations department aims to efficiently analyze large volumes of customer feedback.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze customer reviews on social media using NLP techniques and predict whether customers are satisfied with the product or not. The predictive models will help automate the sentiment analysis process, allowing the team to quickly gauge customer satisfaction without manually reviewing a massive number of tweets or reviews.

## Key Skills

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Data Visualization
- Word Cloud
- Data Cleaning
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Sentiment Analysis

## Input Data

The dataset consists of customer reviews in text format. Each review serves as input for training and testing the sentiment analysis models.

## Project Operations

1. **Data Cleaning:** Perform necessary data cleaning operations to preprocess the textual data.

2. **NLP Processing:** Utilize NLP techniques to convert words into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.

3. **Data Visualization:** Create visualizations, such as word clouds, to gain insights into the most frequent terms and sentiments expressed in the reviews.

4. **Model Building:** Train machine learning models, including Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, for sentiment analysis based on the processed textual data.

5. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics.
